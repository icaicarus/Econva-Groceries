                <p>Yes! Like our journey to sustainability, this project is incomplete. If you know a store or have one of your own that offers alternatives to excessive plastic packaged products, don’t hesitate to contact us.</p>

              <button class="dropdown">What is the submission process like?</button>
              <div class="dropdownContent">
                <p>The process is quite simple. Email our team with the link in the contact page. This leads to your own email client. Simply email us site feedback or store suggestions from there. If you wish to suggest us a store, just tell us what it's called and the region it's in, and you'll see your suggestion on our page soon after!</p>

              <button class="dropdown">Why can't I find my city here/ can I add another city?</button>
              <div class="dropdownContent">
                <p>If you don’t see your city available, it probably means we don’t have any data of eco-friendly grocery stores in the area. If you think we missed it or a brand new store is just opening, don’t hesitate to contact us!</p>
