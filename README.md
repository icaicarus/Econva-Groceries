# Econva Groceries
##### By Joanna F, Maryam K and Marryam K

## Project Overview
Given the task of creating software capable of solving an environmental, social justice or marginalization issue, we as a group decided to create a website. Our chosen issue was that of excessive plastic packaging used for food, especially in grocery stores. So we researched stores in the region taht offer eco-friendly alternatives to traditional plastic-wrapped products and made this website
```
Languages used:
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
```
## Call to action
Using the resources available to us online (*cited in "Credits"*), we offer users an opportunity to learn about the harmful effects of plastic packaging. Additionally, we give them this website as a resource to find eco-friendly grocery stores across the region and contact us to add their own.
